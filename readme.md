# Read-Smore

(cause read-more was already taken ðŸ˜‰)

A little js component / thing for adding a read more / read less feature with pure js.

Highlights:

- Specify word count that's displayed before truncation
- Adds ellipse after truncated content
- Support for multiple instances per page, each with it's own word count
- Preserves existing markup (nice bruv)
- Change Read More / Read Less text via settings object
- Super duper lightweight, no dependencies, vanilla js.
- Read More can me inline with content via css (provided... no biggie)

## Install (via npm)

`npm i read-smore`


## Usage

ReadMore just looks for the class `js-read-more`.

Specify the desired words before truncation with the data attribute `data-rm-words`.

A few baseline styles are provided.

###


#### MarkUp
```

<article>
  <div class="read-more js-read-more" data-rm-words="60">
    <p><!-- some content call here --></p>
  </div>
</article>
```

### Import and init from npm
```
import ReadMore from 'read-smore'

ReadMore.init()
```

### Import and init from your files
```
import ReadMore from './read-more'

ReadMore.init()
```

### Init ES5 approach

Include styles and `src/lib/read-more.es5.js` in your project and:

```
// Maybe check for element first
if (document.querySelector('.js-read-more')) {
  ReadMore.init();
}
```

### Customize

By overwriting the settings object read-smore can be customized:

```
ReadMore.settings = function(){
    return {
        content: document.querySelectorAll('.js-read-more'), 
        originalContentArr: [],
        truncatedContentArr: [],
        moreLink: "Read More",
        lessLink: "Less Link",
    }
};
```


## Caveats

Need to figure out how to handle ReadMore instances with ajaxed/Fetched in content, since the word count on existing instances will be already truncated.

Thinking the solution is to destroy and rebuild via a click event. Or, at least open all and rebuild on click.


## Packing

`src/lib` includes ES5 and ES6 versions, in addition to baseline styles as scss are included.
`src/package` includes es6 and css that's packaged up with [`microbundle`]() for `npm` distribution.


## Todo
- Rename everything to 'ReadSmore'
- Provide a solution for injected content
- Add demo to gh-pages
